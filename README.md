# Fourier's Law of Heat Transfer

This program models the way in which heat diffuses in a thermally conductive material. Fourier's Law of Heat Transfer states that the amount of flux is proportinal to the gradient of the temperature concentration. In otherwords, the initial heat transfer is relatively fast, but soon it levels off as the differences in temperature decreases over time.

This models the partial differential equation in a grid where each box has a temperature that changes over time. The new state is calculated without changing the value of the old state until all values are finally updated.

Blue spots indicate areas of cooler temperature. Red spots indicate areas of warmer temperature.
