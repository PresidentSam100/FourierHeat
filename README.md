# Fourier's Law of Heat Transfer

This program models the way in which heat diffuses in a thermally conductive material. Fourier's Law of Heat Transfer states that the amount of flux is proportinal to the gradient of the temperature concentration.

This models the partial differential equation in a grid where each box has a temperature that changes over time. The new state is calculated without changing the value of the old state until all values are finally updated.
